Delay in AIF

For the delay correction of R, I found that by zero padding the
signals, Ca and C, we could get the right R even AIF if delay by t_d.
However the computed R will be circularly delayed. For instance, if
t_d = 1 sec, R should be

R = [1 0.5 0 0]

when there is no delay.

But when there is delay, R_d will be

R_d = [0.5 0 0 1]

This is the result output by the MATLAB code bcsvd_long.m

In that case, we should circularly shift R_d right by 1 sec to make it
R_shifted = [1 0.5 0 0].
